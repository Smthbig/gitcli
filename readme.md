## Why Git Genius?

Git is powerful, but the command-line workflow can be confusing, especially for new developers.

Git Genius provides:
- a menu-driven interface
- guided setup and validation
- smart handling of common Git problems
- clear messages instead of cryptic errors

You focus on your code. Git Genius manages the Git workflow.

These features are **not promises**, but the architecture is intentionally built to support them.

## Disclaimer

Git Genius is a helper tool, not a replacement for Git knowledge.

- It wraps Git commands; it does not modify Git itself
- You are still responsible for your repositories
- Always review actions before confirming

Use responsibly, especially on important repositories.
